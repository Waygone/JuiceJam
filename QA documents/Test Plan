      Music loops properly.
    
    More in depth level 1 design: 🌍

      |
      If obstacles are added and Player can take damage:
        Make sure the collisions feel right.
    
    Player movement: 🤾‍♀️

      |

      |
      If energy system added:
        Abilities drain energy meter.
        |
        I can't use abilities when energy meter is empty.
        |
      If player double jump has been added:
        Player can tell when they still have a double jump left. (For example, Madeline's hair color changes to blue if she has already dashed
        and hasn't touched the ground yet in Celeste.)
        |
        Second jump doesn't execute if Player is right above ground and is falling. (User may have intended to jump off the ground as opposed to executing
        the second jump and may wonder why they can't jump a second time if second jump was already executed.)
      
      If player dash has been added:
        Player can tell when they can dash.
        |
        Player can't dash through walls.

        Player can't use dash to access anything they're not supposed to.

User testing: 💻
  Testers: people who haven't seen this game before, but preferably play games in general.
  Things to test:
    Usability: 🧟‍♂️
      The game is easy to understand.
      |
      User can navigate menus.
      |
      Graphics convey the functions of the things they represent. (eg. spikes are pointy, platforms are separate from background, etc.)

      The difficulty curve is correct.
      |
      The actions are satisfying.


--------------------------------------------------


Other tests: 👽
  Testers: Vincent
  Things to test:
    Pausing: ⏸
      Everything that is expected to pause does when game is paused.
      |
      Pausing and unpausing rapidly doesn't break anything.
    
    Physics: 👨‍🔬
      Make sure objects move, accelerate and decelerate at the same rate accross all framerates. (If speeds are different you probably need to multiply 
      the rate of movement/acceleration/deceleration by Time.deltaTime)
    
    UI: 🔍
      Everything is spelled correctly.
      |
      Game can't be unpaused by pressing the escape key if in fullscreen and if pressing the escape key exits fullscreen. This might disorient users and cause
      them to take damage or die.
      
    Transitions: 🎬
      When user goes from any level to title screen and hits the play button to go back to game everything is reset properly if need be.
