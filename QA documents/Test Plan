Version 2: 2️⃣
  Testers: Vincent
  Things to test:

      Music plays when it should.
      |

    More in depth level 1 design: 🌍
      I can navigate the level without any trouble.
      |
      If obstacles are added and Player can take damage:
        Make sure the collisions feel right.
    
    Player movement abilities: 🤾‍♀️
      If energy system added:
        Abilities drain energy meter.
        |
      If player double jump has been added:
        Player can tell when they still have a double jump left. (For example, Madeline's hair color changes to blue if she has already dashed
        and hasn't touched the ground yet in Celeste.)
        |
        Second jump doesn't execute if Player is right above ground and is falling. (User may have intended to jump off the ground as opposed to executing
        the second jump and may wonder why they can't jump a second time if second jump was already executed.)
      
      Basic starter enemy finalised: 😈
        Enemy can attack.
        Enemy attacks feel fair.

        Level is still visible under non-ideal lighting conditions.
